                        This document is created in accordance with the rules of
                        international law and business practice. <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?> accepts individuals aged 18. The
                        registration procedure is necessary for each <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?> client. You agree with terms
                        and conditions by being a client of <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?>.
                        <h5 class="fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Investment Rules</h5>
                        Every deposit is considered to be a private transaction between <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?> and its
                        client.
                        Clients process all financial transactions solely at their own discretion and their own risk.
                        The size and term of deposit is determined personally by each client.
                        Accrual of interest on the investment is calculated and credited to client's account at the end
                        of investment term for "After" investment plans and daily on 'Daily' investment plans.
                        The principal is included in profit in 'After' investment plans and not included (will be
                        returned after the deposit expiration) on 'Daily' investment plans.
                        The interest rate depends on the amount of investment, investment plan and deposit term.
                        Client can use our Profit Calculator for an accurate calculation of his/her profit.
                        Client may choose any payment system or cryptocurrency that we accept in order to make a
                        deposit. <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?> accepts only USD for investing.

                        contact us before at <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['email']) ?>. If a new account is opened, the old account
                        will be closed.
                        <h5 class="fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Antispam Rules</h5>
                        Spam is commercial e-mail or unsolicited bulk e-mail, including "junk mail", which has not been
                        requested by the recipient. It is intrusive and often irrelevant or offensive, and it wastes
                        valuable resources. Inappropriate newsgroup activities, consisting of excessive posting of the
                        same materials to several newsgroups, are also deemed to be spam. We don't tolerate SPAM in our
                        company.
                        We forbid unsolicited e-mails of any kind in connection with the marketing of the services
                        provided by <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?>.
                        If any law enforcement agency, internet provider, web hosting provider or other person or entity
                        provide us with notice that you may have engaged in transmission of unsolicited e-mails or may
                        have engaged in otherwise unlawful conduct or conduct in violation of an internet service
                        provider's terms of service or any such policies or regulations, we will reserve the right to
                        cooperate in any investigation relating to your activities including disclosure of your account
                        information.
                        If you didn't receive a letter from <?php echo $this->security->xss_clean($companyInfo['name']) ?>, please don't forget to check your Spam
                        folder because some email services may mark our email as Spam.
